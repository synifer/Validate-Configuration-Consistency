# Code Overview and Purpose

This script is a robust solution designed for validating and comparing configuration data from Cisco IOS-XE devices with pre-defined reference data stored in a CSV file. 
It primarily targets scenarios where network engineers need to:

1. **Validate Configuration Consistency:**

- Ensures that key parameters in the device configuration match those defined in a template CSV file.
- Highlights discrepancies to identify potential misconfigurations or manual errors.

2. **Extract and Analyze Key Information:**

- Extracts key data points such as hostname, system IP, serial numbers, VLAN IDs, IP addresses (with and without masks), and interface descriptions from the IOS-XE configuration file.
- Compares these extracted values with corresponding values from a CSV file.

3. **Generate a Comprehensive Validation Report:**

- Outputs a detailed CSV report showing matched and mismatched values between the configuration file and the CSV.

**Key Features**

1. **Flexible Parsing:**

- Handles complex configuration structures, including subinterfaces and multiple interface types like Loopback and GigabitEthernet.
- Extracts both system-wide parameters (e.g., hostname, system IP) and interface-specific details.

2. **Dynamic Mapping:**

- Uses a customizable normalization_map to map variables from the CSV to the corresponding configuration parameters.
- Easily extendable for different configurations or CSV formats.

3. **Error-Handling and Debugging:**

- Provides detailed DEBUG logs to track data extraction and validation steps.
- Handles missing data gracefully, ensuring the script does not break due to incomplete inputs.

4. **Automated Comparison:**

- Automatically compares configuration data against the CSV and generates a report for further analysis.
